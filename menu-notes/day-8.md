# Day 8

## Breakfast

We have come to realize that our baby boy does not really like baby marrows or
rice cereal balls. We don't think it's due to teething that he doesn't eat them.

For breakast, after he wasn't eating anything else (chicken puree and rice
cereal balls), we decided to try giving him some of the rice cereal in breast
milk. Contrary to the baby-led weaning method, we did spoon-feed it to him. He
seemed to like it. He didn't refuse it in the same way he refuses the cereal
balls and baby marrows when we offer them to him. We're going to try the same
again for supper.
