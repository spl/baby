# Day 1 (Sunday, 2017-12-03)

Today was the first day of introducing solids. Our baby is exactly 26 weeks old
and 1 day shy of his 6-month birth anniversary. It was also a Sunday, when we
had the time to relax when preparing his food and enjoying the breakfast time
with him.

We started with [baby marrows](../recipes/baby-marrow.md). As it turned out, we
were very happy with that choice. They seem to be excellent for the baby as well
as very tasty without any added flavorings.

We prepared 3 baby marrows with the idea that we would also eat them. But it
turned out that having backups was a good idea for a different reason: every
time the baby dropped a marrow, one of us could quickly reload his table while
the other washed off the dropped one.

I didn't expect the baby to take to it so readily. I thought the marrow would
mostly end up on the floor. But it wasn't long at all before he managed to bring
the vegetable to his mouth and actually get something out of it. For the most
part, he extracted juice, and that juice, for the most part, ran down his chin.
But he continued trying, both to actually grab the marrow—which was difficult at
times—and to put it in his mouth.
