# Day 15

Our new food today is the carrot. We boiled for over 30 minutes: it was pliant
but still didn't seem soft enough.

The baby did put it in his mouth and made a face. We'll see if he'll try again
tomorrow.

In addition to carrots, we wanted to see how he liked begin spoon-fed plain
yogurt, the same ingredient in the cereal balls but without the cereal. He seems
to like it.
