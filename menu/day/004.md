# Day 4 (Wednesday, 2017-12-06)

We offered 1 [cereal ball](../food/cereal-balls.md) and 1 baby marrow. For
cereal, we used Purity Rice. (We could not find Purity Maize in the store.)

As with [day 3](./003.md), the baby was not very interested in putting food in
his mouth. It may be the teething (though I'm not fully convinced on that), or
it may be a phase.

I think it's useful to remind myself at this point that part of the reason for
the baby-led weaning approach is so that the baby can learn to feed himself.
There were times during breakfast when I “broke the rules” and offered the baby
some of the food to his mouth from my hand. I wanted to see if he would take it
(and get the taste), and he did, to an extent. But I should really let him go at
his own pace. His motor skills are not yet there, and letting him shove the food
around is still useful, even if he's not getting the nutrition from it. Patience
is the name of the game, I suppose.
