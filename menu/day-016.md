# Day 16 (Monday, 2017-12-18)

## Breakfast

He tried his first white flesh sweet potato and strawberry today.

Although the menu principles we've been following require us to give the baby
one new food every four days, we have been running out of options that he will
eat, leaving us with little variety in the old food that we can provide in
addition to the new food.

Currently, our baby will only eat plain yogurt and bananas. For everything else,
he gives a face of disgust and pushes out of his mouth. 

So, we broke the rules (again) today and gave him two new foods. The purpose of
the four-day rule is to allow time for allergies to manifest. We do not expect
any sweet potato allergy, so if anything appears, it will most likely be to
strawberries.

Well, the baby did not like the sweet potato, which was boiled and, admittedly,
tasteless. But he loved the fresh strawberry.

If we were to extrapolate from his current likes — plain yogurt, bananas, and
strawberries — our guess would be that he likes sweet and sour foods.

Tomorrow, we will try oven-cooked sweet potatoes, instead of boiled, to retain
more of the flavor.
