# Day 3 (2017-12-05)

We again gave the baby two baby marrows. He decided, however, that he wasn't
very interested in putting them in his mouth. He mostly played around for a
while before we took the vegtables away. He did drink his milk afterwards.

We later discovered that the baby's first tooth was erupting today. That could
explain his lack of appetite.
