# Cereal Balls

A cereal ball is a dough-like ball made of fortified baby cereal and plain
yogurt.

It is a useful mechanism for getting the needed nutrients such as iron into a
baby's diet while still following the baby-led weaning approach of letting the
baby feed herself rather than spoon-feeding her.

It's important to not introduce foods with added sugar (or sugar substitutes) or
added salt (or salt substitutes) into a baby's diet. So, you should use a baby
cereal that does not have any sugar or added flavoring. The only commercial baby
cereals fitting this description that I have seen so far (in South Africa) are:

* Purity Rice
* Purity Maize

For yogurt, you should also not use any flavored variety, because those have
added sugar. Use only plain yogurt, low-fat or full-fat.

## Preparation

1. Add equal amounts of cereal powder and yogurt to a bowl.
2. Stir with a spoon and combine (scraping the sides of the bowl as necessary)
   until the mix has a light, doughy consistency and doesn't stick to the bowl.
3. If needed, add small amounts of yogurt (or cereal powder) to reach this
   consistency.
4. Use the spoon to form balls out of the dough.
5. Serve as many cereal balls as desired.
