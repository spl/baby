# Carrots

Carrots are good, simple starter foods.

We first tried boiling a carrot to give to the baby. We boiled it for at least
45 minutes, perhaps longer. Unfortunately, the baby didn't like it. For me, it
lacked nearly all of its flavor.

We next tried baking a carrot in the oven for 1 hour. It was soft and, this
time, flavorful. Unfortunately, the baby didn't like this either.
