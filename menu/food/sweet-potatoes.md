# Sweet Potatoes

Sweet potatos in South Africa come in (at least) two varieties: white flesh and
orange flesh.

We first gave the baby a white-flesh sweet potato, boiled. He didn't like it.
For me, it lacked nearly all of its flavor.

We next tried baking the white-flesh sweet potato in the oven for 1 hour. It was
soft and, this time, flavorful. Fortunately, the baby seemed to like it this
time.
