# Baby Marrow

Baby [marrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marrow_(vegetable)) is a small, long
green vegetable.

I think it is an excellent starter food for a baby learning to eat solids:

* The length makes it easy for the child to hold and put into his mouth.
* The skin and firmness (but still very soft to the touch after steaming) mean
  that he can hold it intact without squashing it immediately into a pulp.
* When steamed, it becomes very juicy. When the baby is first trying to put it
  into his mouth, he may not be very successful at actually eating it, but
  he may still be able to extract some of the juice and get those nutrients as
  well as the taste.
* It's easy to rinse off the vegetable after the baby drops it on the floor.

## Preparation

### Stove

1. Bring a small amount of water to boil in a pot on the stove at a medium-high
   heat (4 out of 6 on our stove).
   * The volume should be enough to partially cover the baby marrows but not
     boil away completely.
2. Wash the baby marrows and add them to the pot.
3. Steam for approximately 15 minutes.
   * Watch to make sure the water doesn't all boil away.
   * The baby marrows should be soft and pliable but not pulpy.
4. Remove the baby marrows, cut the ends off, let them cool to room temperature,
   and serve.
