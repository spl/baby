# Day 2 (Monday, 2017-12-04)

Today, we gave the baby two baby marrows.

At first, we put both baby marrows on the tray of his highchair. He grabbed both
and started breaking them apart while eating. In retrospect, it is probably
better at this stage to give him one at a time, as he finishes them (or
demolishes them beyond the ability to hold). This would allow him to focus on
holding and eating only one at a time.

The baby achieved the first bite of baby marrow that stayed in his mouth. We
also had our first choking worry. He gagged twice. We gave him a bit of water in
a bottle. In the end, all was okay. We're not sure whether or not he actually
swallowed some solids.
