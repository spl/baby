# Day 15 (Sunday, 2017-12-17)

## Breakfast

The baby does not like carrots in any form, it seems. We thought we'd try a
different form of carrot that wasn't a stick, so we made mash by pushing boiled
carrots through a strainer (sieve). But it wasn't any more palatable than the
sticks were.

## Lunch

Today was his first lunch. We gave him bananas, one of his favorites.

## Supper

He will not eat rice cereal in formula anymore. At this point, we tried it again
after taking a break from it, but he cried instead. He used to eat it, even
though he didn't enjoy it, but no longer.
